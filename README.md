# langparser

**langparser** is an open-source toolkit for intelligent document parsing, layout analysis, and multimodal content extraction. It leverages state-of-the-art visual-language models (VLMs) and layout segmentation algorithms to accurately restore the structure and content of complex documents, including magazines, academic papers, newspapers, and more.

## Features

- **Intelligent Layout Segmentation**  
  Automatically detects and segments document elements: titles, paragraphs, images, tables (with merged cells), formulas, headers, footers, page numbers, and more.

- **Visual-Language Model Integration**  
  Utilizes advanced VLMs for high-fidelity extraction of text, tables, formulas (LaTeX), and images, supporting both plain text and Markdown/HTML output.

- **Reading Order Reconstruction**  
  Restores the natural reading flow of multi-column, multi-block, and complex layouts, overcoming limitations of traditional OCR.

- **Fine-Grained Structure Output**  
  Outputs detailed, multi-level structured data including bounding boxes (bbox), element types, and hierarchical relationships.

- **Flexible Output Formats**  
  Supports plain text, Markdown, HTML, and structured JSON for downstream retrieval, editing, and content reorganization.

- **High Performance**  
  Parallel model inference and optimized pipelines deliver up to 10x faster processing compared to traditional visual-only solutions.

## Use Cases

- Magazine and newspaper digitization
- Academic paper and technical document parsing
- Enterprise document management
- Data extraction for AI/ML applications
- Digital archiving and search
